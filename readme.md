# Multilingual Speech-to-Text and Text Processing Pipeline

creating a multilingual speech recognition model that works without needing any additional training, using an existing pre-trained multilingual speech model like Multilingual Whisper. This project aims to empower the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model to handle tasks in multiple languages, enhancing its capabilities beyond single-language tasks.
demonstrates a complete pipeline for converting spoken language in various languages into text using OpenAI's Whisper model, and then translating and summarizing the text using the MarianMT and BART models from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

**Prerequisites**

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9.6  or above

pip (Python package installer)

Install the required Python libraries:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Usage
To run the speech-to-text transcription:

`from transcribe import transcribe_audio
`
`audio_path = 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3'`

`transcribed_text = transcribe_audio(audio_path)`

`print("Transcribed Text:", transcribed_text)'`

**For translating text:**

`from translate import translate_text`

`translated_text = translate_text(transcribed_text, 'en', 'fr')  # English to French
`

`print("Translated Text:", translated_text)`

**For summarizing text:**

`from summarize import summarize_text`

`summary = summarize_text(transcribed_text)`

`print("Summary:", summary)`

Project Structure

`transcribe.py`: Contains the function transcribe_audio which uses Whisper for speech recognition.

`translate.py`: Contains the function translate_text using MarianMT for translation.

`summarize.py`: Contains the function summarize_text using BART for summarization.

`requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies.
